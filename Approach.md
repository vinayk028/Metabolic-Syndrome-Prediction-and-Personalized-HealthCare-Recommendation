## Dataset

- Original Dataset Contains almost 50
- Genetic Algorithm is basically (Selection of the Fittest which gets the Better Off Springs)
- Like Wise Here, We need to select the Best Features for the Model Prediction


chromosome could represent a combination of health features

Fitness Function: Will select the different combinations of Features Using Naive Baye's (Which get's the best chromosome for the prediction)

### Genetic Operators:
Selection: Select the best performing individuals (solutions) based on fitness.
Crossover and Mutation: Introduce new features or combinations to evolve better predictive models over generations.
Termination: The algorithm runs until it converges on a model that predicts MetS risk with high accuracy.


## Recommended System
Fitness Function: Evaluate the effectiveness of a medication combination based on how well it addresses the patient's condition while minimizing side effects and interactions.


Requirements:
1. Model Prediction Using GA
2. Recommendation System Using GA?
3. Any UI Needed?
